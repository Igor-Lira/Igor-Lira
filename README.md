I double graduated in Software Engineering at Centrale Nantes (France) and Civil Engineering at the Federal University of Cear√° (Brazil).


I have over 2 years of experience working with Web Development. I really enjoy solving challenging problems and learning new technologies, reasons why I pursue a Software Engineer career.


I master the VueJs framework (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript), building responsive interfaces in well-architected projects. Not only that, but I also work with NodeJs, Express, databases, ORM, and other useful stacks to create a server-side application.
